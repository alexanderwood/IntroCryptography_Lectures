\frametitle{A main function}

Now we wish to write a \verb|main| function.
\begin{itemize}
\item First, instantiate a \verb|CellPhone| object called \verb|c|
\item Prompt the user to set values for the attributes of \verb|c| with calls to the \verb|set_price|, \verb|set_manufact|, and \verb|set_model| methods.
\item Next ask the user which attribute they would like to display and use the \verb|get_price|, \verb|get_manufact|, and \verb|get_model| methods to display it for them. Ask the user if they would like to display another attribute and repeat until the user wishes to quit.
\end{itemize}
